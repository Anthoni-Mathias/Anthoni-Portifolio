This static website is designed as an online portfilio taht can be used during and after my time learning and creating with the Code Institute. It can viewed [here](https://anthoni-mathias.github.io/Portifolio-number-2/). It utilises HTML, CSS and Bootstrap.
## UX
This website was primarily designed with prospective clients in mind. I envisioned my ideal costumer to be a small business owner looking for a website tailored to their busines needs and ethos. They needes to find navigating the site an easy and intuitive experience, and this needed to be true they viewed my website on a mobile device, tablet or computer.

#### User Stories 
- As a small business owner in need of a website, I want to view a website where I can really get a sense of the designer, what they have done for other businesses and what they can do for me. I want a sense that a I will be working with a real person who really cares about the website they will build for me and the impact it will have on my business.  

- As a prospective employer for a web development company, I just need a way to see that my potential employee can develop a good website, view a portfolio of their work, and then download and print their CV, so I can assess their skills and experience and decide on whether to contact them for an interview.

#### Wireframes
Two wireframes guided the end design of this project, the first is for mobile devices, and the second scales up this for larger devices. I made both using [balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/).

- [Wireframe for larger devices](https://github.com/Anthoni-Mathias/Portifolio-number-2/blob/main/assets/readme-images/desktop-wireframe.png)

#### Colour Scheme
I chose the two core colours for my website: #cccccc and #006666, wich contrast well and look clean. All colours used are based around these, being either tints or shades and provide consistency that ties togheder all sections of the website.
