This static website is designed as an online portfilio taht can be used during and after my time learning and creating with the Code Institute. It can viewed [here](https://anthoni-mathias.github.io/Portifolio-number-2/). It utilises HTML, CSS and Bootstrap.
## UX
This website was primarily designed with prospective clients in mind. I envisioned my ideal costumer to be a small business owner looking for a website tailored to their busines needs and ethos. They needes to find navigating the site an easy and intuitive experience, and this needed to be true they viewed my website on a mobile device, tablet or computer.
